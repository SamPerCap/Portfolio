<p id="Primer">My name is Samuel, I am 20 years old and I come from Spain, Málaga.<br />
I arrived to Denmark on 2016, August.<br />
I am studying in Esbjerg since my first step. I started with multimedia and design, but who know where I will finish.<br />
I am very interested in computer science and I wish I work on it.<br /></p>

<p id="Segun">If my friends have to describe me, two things I am sure they will tell<br />
you will be "positive" and "history lover".<br />
I am a person who see the positive things anywhere, even I am
suffering a bad moment, I am able to see some thing positive and<br />
maybe it is worth it.
<br /><br />
​One of my biggest passions is the history. I think if you want to <br />
understand the present, you have to understand the past.<br />
Everything that we see has an history which want to be heard and <br />
the history builds our life.</p>
